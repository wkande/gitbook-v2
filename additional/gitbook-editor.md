# Online Editor

The online editor provides Markdown extensions unique to GitBook which can be useful. They appear in the repo as follows.

```text
{% hint style="info" %} A ticket has been submitted to GitBook to determine if a variant can be hidden independently of other variants. {% endhint %}
```

### Saving and Merging

When the editor **Saves** the draft it is stored on a GitBook managed server. It is not moved to the GitHub repo until it is **Merged**.

Changes to all variants do not appear to Users until the draft is merged.

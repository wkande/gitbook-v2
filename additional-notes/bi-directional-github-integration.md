# Bi-directional GitHub integration

Integrating GitBook with GitHub can provide changes made outside of the GitBook online editor to sync back to GitBook. This can be problematic if changes made to the repo by other tools end up overwriting the GitBook saved \(not merged\) image.

When using the online editor it may be best to have GitHub contributors push to a repo branch that is not integrated. Then let the author figure out the merge to a branch \(variant\). It may be that the author would copy and paste the changes from a designated GitHub branch to the online editor if that is the only or easiest solution.
